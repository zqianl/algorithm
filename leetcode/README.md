1. Given an array of integers, every element appears twice except for one. Find that single one.    Note:Your algorithm should have a linear runtime complexity. Could you implement it without using extra memory?
2. Given a non-negative integer represented as a non-empty array of digits, plus one to the integer.You may assume the integer do not contain any leading zero, except the number 0 itself.The digits are stored such that the most significant digit is at the head of the list.
3. Write an efficient algorithm that searches for a value in an m x n matrix. This matrix has the following properties:Integers in each row are sorted from left to right.The first integer of each row is greater than the last integer of the previous row.
For example,Consider the following matrix:
	[[1,   3,  5,  7],[10, 11, 16, 20],[23, 30, 34, 50]
	] Given target = 3, return true.
